# High-Level Architecture Diagram for Event Storming Application

## Components

- **Frontend**
  - React Application
    - Components
      - App
      - Dashboard
      - Canvas
      - Editor
      - StickyList
      - Sticky (Base Class)
      - Various Sticky Types (Event, Policy, Actor, Command, ReadModel)
    - State Management
    - User Interface (Material-UI)

- **Backend**
  - Express.js Application
    - Controllers
      - Events Controller
      - Policies Controller
      - Actors Controller
      - Commands Controller
      - ReadModels Controller
    - Models
      - Event Model
      - Policy Model
      - Actor Model
      - Command Model
      - ReadModel Model
    - Routes
      - Events Route
      - Policies Route
      - Actors Route
      - Commands Route
      - ReadModels Route
    - Database Connection (MongoDB)

- **Database**
  - MongoDB
    - Collections for Events, Policies, Actors, Commands, ReadModels

- **Development Tools**
  - Docker (for containerization)
  - Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction)
  - Axios (for HTTP requests)

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the React frontend.
2. **API Requests**: Frontend makes API requests to the Express backend.
3. **Database Operations**: Backend processes requests and interacts with MongoDB.
4. **Data Rendering**: Frontend updates UI based on responses from the backend.

## Summary

- The architecture consists of a React frontend that communicates with an Express backend.
- The backend interacts with a MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations.
- The application is designed to facilitate event storming with various resources represented as "stickies."
