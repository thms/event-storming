## Project Overview
This project is a microservice-based application designed for event storming, allowing users to create and manage various resources such as events, policies, actors, commands, and read models.

## API Endpoints

- **PUT /events/:id**: Update an existing event by ID.
- **DELETE /events/:id**: Delete an event by ID.

### Policies
- **GET /policies**: Retrieve a list of all policies.
- **GET /policies/:id**: Retrieve a specific policy by ID.
- **POST /policies**: Create a new policy.
- **PUT /policies/:id**: Update an existing policy by ID.
- **DELETE /policies/:id**: Delete a policy by ID.

### Actors
- **GET /actors**: Retrieve a list of all actors.
- **GET /actors/:id**: Retrieve a specific actor by ID.
- **POST /actors**: Create a new actor.
- **PUT /actors/:id**: Update an existing actor by ID.

### Commands
- **GET /commands**: Retrieve a list of all commands.
- **GET /commands/:id**: Retrieve a specific command by ID.
- **POST /commands**: Create a new command.
- **PUT /commands/:id**: Update an existing command by ID.
- **DELETE /commands/:id**: Delete a command by ID.

### Read Models
- **GET /readModels**: Retrieve a list of all read models.
- **GET /readModels/:id**: Retrieve a specific read model by ID.
- **POST /readModels**: Create a new read model.
- **PUT /readModels/:id**: Update an existing read model by ID.
- **DELETE /readModels/:id**: Delete a read model by ID.

## Data Model

### Event Model
```javascript
const EventSchema = new Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true, max: 100 },
    xpos: { type: Number, required: true },
    ypos: { type: Number, required: true }
});
```

### Policy Model
```javascript
const PolicySchema = new Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true, max: 100 },
    xpos: { type: Number, required: true },
    ypos: { type: Number, required: true }
});
```

### Actor Model
```javascript
const ActorSchema = new Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true, max: 100 },
    xpos: { type: Number, required: true },
    ypos: { type: Number, required: true }
});
```

### Command Model
```javascript
const CommandSchema = new Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true, max: 100 },
    xpos: { type: Number, required: true },
    ypos: { type: Number, required: true }
});
```

### Read Model
```javascript
const ReadModelSchema = new Schema({
    name: { type: String, required: true, max: 100 },
    xpos: { type: Number, required: true },
    ypos: { type: Number, required: true }
});
```

## Business Logic
- The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete resources (events, policies, actors, commands, and read models).
- Each resource is represented as a sticky note on a canvas, which can be manipulated (dragged, resized) and edited.
- The application communicates with a MongoDB database to persist data.

## Events Consumed
- The application consumes events related to CRUD operations for each resource type (events, policies, actors, commands, read models).

## Events Published
- The application publishes events when resources are created, updated, or deleted, allowing for real-time updates and synchronization across clients.

## Conclusion
This microservice architecture provides a flexible and scalable solution for managing event storming resources, enabling collaborative and interactive experiences for users.
